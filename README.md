## üìú The Story
Have you ever **struggled with correcting pronunciation errors** in text-to-speech (TTS) based on a large language model (LLM) architecture due to a **lack of an explicit grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) module**? Don't we have a way to control pronunciation, **including prosody**, in such a case?

**No**. ***UtterTune*** is a lightweight LoRA adapter and toolset to edit and control **phoneme-level pronunciation and prosody** in LLM-TTS with no explicit G2P. Currently, UtterTune supports **Japanese** in **[CosyVoice 2](https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice)**.

Omitting G2P modules facilitates multilingual training, leading to superb performance in many languages. Users lost, instead, phoneme-level pronunciation controllability. Lacking controllability matters for non-eligible users ‚Äì **I *was* one of them**.

**Now we have UtterTune**. UtterTune users can teach correct pronunciation to the model using phonograms (kana in the case of Japanese) enclosed by newly-introduced special tag tokens. The size of the UtterTune model is **less than 10MB**, thanks to low-rank adapter (LoRA) technology, while the original CosyVoice 2-0.5B model size is close to 1 GB.

Why not try using Japanese CosyVoice 2 **more comfortably** with UtterTune's pretrained model? Or why not try training your own custom UtterTune?


## ‚ú®Ô∏è Features
### LoRA fine-tuning
UtterTune doesn't need full fine-tuning for the base model‚Äôs LLM component.

### Special token injection
`<PHON_START>`, `<PHON_END>` is newly introduced for phoneme-level pronunciation control.

### No interference with other languages' performance
Because you only need LoRA for the target language.

### Pretrained LoRA weights are available
On Hugging Face (*non-commercial license* due to the training data).

cd UtterTune
git submodule update --init --recursive


## Setup
### Update submodules
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Download pretrained models
```bash
mkdir -p pretrained_models

# Download CosyVoice2-0.5B

# Add path to CosyVoice repository
python - <<'PY'
import site, os
sp = next(p for p in site.getsitepackages() if p.endswith("site-packages"))
pth = os.path.join(sp, "cosyvoice_submodule.pth")
with open(pth, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    f.write(os.path.abspath("submodules/CosyVoice") + "\n")
    f.write(os.path.abspath("submodules/CosyVoice/third_party/Matcha-TTS") + "\n")
print("Wrote:", pth)
